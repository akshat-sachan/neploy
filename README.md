 **Improvised Code.py follow the below instructions** (https://github.com/lokeshwaran100/neploy/blob/main/src/backend/Improvised%20Code.py)
 
 lets get started as how to run and deploy the above along with input 

Install the necessary Python libraries. You can do this using the pip install command:
pip install numpy pandas sklearn
Save the code in a file called code_optimization_model.py.

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.

Run the following command to run the code:
python code_optimization_model.py

This will print the classification report for the model.


To deploy the model, you can use a variety of methods, such as:

Saving the model to a file and loading it into a production environment.
Using a cloud-based machine learning service, such as Google Cloud AI Platform or Amazon SageMaker.
Building a web application that uses the model to predict code improvements.
The best way to deploy the model will depend on your specific needs and requirements.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind when running and deploying the code:

The code uses the TfidfVectorizer method to convert code snippets into numerical features. This method takes into account the frequency of words and phrases in the code.
The code uses the RandomForestClassifier method to train the model. This method is a type of ensemble learning that uses multiple decision trees to make predictions.
The code uses the classification report metric to evaluate the model. This metric measures the accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score of the model.
To predict the suggested improvement for a new code snippet, you can run the following code:
