 **Improvised Code.py follow the below instructions** (https://github.com/lokeshwaran100/neploy/blob/main/src/backend/Improvised%20Code.py)

Install the necessary Python libraries. You can do this using the pip install command:
pip install numpy pandas sklearn
Save the code in a file called code_optimization_model.py.
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
Run the following command to run the code:
python code_optimization_model.py
 
use **TfidfVectorizer instead of CountVectorize**r. TF-IDF takes into account the importance of words in the context of the entire dataset, potentially leading to more meaningful features for classification.

The**tokenizer function is used with split()** to tokenize the code snippets.

We've tuned **hyperparameters for the RandomForestClassifier by specifying n_estimators and max_depth for better model performance**
The classification report provides more detailed evaluation metrics.

Remember that in a real-world scenario, you'd want a much larger and more diverse dataset, and you might also consider more advanced preprocessing techniques, using different models, and potentially incorporating more features from the code.
