 **Improvised Code.py follow the below instructions** ( https://github.com/lokeshwaran100/neploy/blob/main/src/backend/Improvised%20Code.py)
 
use **TfidfVectorizer instead of CountVectorize**r. TF-IDF takes into account the importance of words in the context of the entire dataset, potentially leading to more meaningful features for classification.

The**tokenizer function is used with split()** to tokenize the code snippets.

We've tuned **hyperparameters for the RandomForestClassifier by specifying n_estimators and max_depth for better model performance**
The classification report provides more detailed evaluation metrics.

Remember that in a real-world scenario, you'd want a much larger and more diverse dataset, and you might also consider more advanced preprocessing techniques, using different models, and potentially incorporating more features from the code.





**ML code Optimization.py file follow below instructions** 

In practice, you'll need a much larger and diverse dataset for better model performance.
Data preprocessing can involve tokenization, removing stopwords, stemming, etc.
Model selection and hyperparameter tuning are crucial for good results.
You might need more advanced features, such as AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) analysis, to capture code structure.
ML models might not always provide precise recommendations for code optimization. They can provide hints, but human expertise is essential.
Deployment of such a model could involve creating a service/API to integrate with development tools.
