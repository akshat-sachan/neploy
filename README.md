 **Improvised Code.py follow the below instructions** (https://github.com/lokeshwaran100/neploy/blob/main/src/backend/Improvised%20Code.py)
 
 lets get started as how to run and deploy the above along with input 

Install the necessary Python libraries. You can do this using the pip install command:
pip install numpy pandas sklearn

Save the code in a file called code_optimization_model.py.

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.

To run the code with an input file, you can use the following command:
python code_optimization_model.py input.txt
Where input.txt is the path to the input file. The file should contain one smart contract code snippet per line.

To run the code with an input string, you can use the following command:

python code_optimization_model.py "uint256 totalSupply = 1000000;"
The output of the code will be the suggested improvement for the input code snippet.

To deploy the model, you can use a variety of methods, such as:

Saving the model to a file and loading it into a production environment.
Using a cloud-based machine learning service, such as Google Cloud AI Platform or Amazon SageMaker.
Building a web application that uses the model to predict code improvements.
The best way to deploy the model will depend on your specific needs and requirements.
