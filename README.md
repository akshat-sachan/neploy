## Project Overview

Neploy addresses the common challenges faced by developers when it comes to working with Neo smart contracts. Compiling, deploying, and testing these contracts manually can be time-consuming and error-prone. Neploy simplifies this process by providing an intuitive web portal that interacts with a Kubernetes-based backend to streamline the entire workflow.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Portal:** Neploy offers a user-friendly web portal that allows developers to effortlessly deploy their Neo smart contracts without the need for intricate setup steps.

- **Automated Compilation:** The smart contract deployment process includes automated compilation, ensuring that the code is error-free before being sent to the blockchain.

- **Effortless Testing:** Developers can easily test their smart contracts within the Neploy environment, enabling rapid iteration and bug detection.

- **AI-Powered Code Review:** Neploy leverages AI and machine learning to provide code optimization suggestions, enhancing the quality and efficiency of the smart contracts.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Kubernetes is utilized to containerize the backend, ensuring scalability and efficient resource management. Machine Learning based in Python for code optimization.

- **Frontend:** The frontend is developed using JavaScript, providing a seamless interface for users to interact with the backend's exposed endpoints.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with Neploy:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/lokeshwaran100/neploy.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd neploy`
3. Set up the Kubernetes environment for the backend.
4. Launch the frontend application by opening the `http://127.0.0.1:8080` file in your preferred web browser.
